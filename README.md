# Digital Critical Edition of Filippo Cavriana's Correspondence

This project presents the first comprehensive digital edition of Filippo Cavriana's (1536-1606) correspondence, drawn from the *Mediceo del Principato* collection at the [State Archives of Florence](http://www.archiviodistato.firenze.it/). As a physician at the court of France, and a spy for the grand dukes of Tuscany, Cavriana's letters provide crucial insights into the French Wars of Religion, the ideas, and the language of 16th-century politics.
